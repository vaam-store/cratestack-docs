# Migrations

Banks ship database changes the same way they ship code: a reviewable SQL
diff, recorded in source control, applied once, never edited after the
fact. CrateStack's migration runner enforces that contract.

## Shape

A migration is a struct, not a file convention — banks integrate it into
whatever build tooling they already use:

```rust
use cratestack::Migration;

let migrations = vec![
    Migration {
        id: "20260101000000_create_accounts".to_owned(),
        description: "create accounts table".to_owned(),
        up: r#"
            CREATE TABLE accounts (
                id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
                balance NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
                version BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
            );
            CREATE INDEX accounts_balance_idx ON accounts (balance);
        "#.to_owned(),
        down: None,
    },
    Migration {
        id: "20260201000000_add_currency".to_owned(),
        description: "add currency to accounts".to_owned(),
        up: "ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN currency TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD';".to_owned(),
        down: None,
    },
];
```

Conventions banks adopt:

1. `id` is sortable — `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_<slug>` is canonical
2. `description` is short and human-readable
3. `up` is the SQL applied forward; multiple statements are split on `;` and run in one transaction
4. `down` is recorded but **never executed** by the runner — irreversible-by-default is the safe banking posture

## Running

```rust
use cratestack::{apply_pending, status, ensure_migrations_table};

ensure_migrations_table(&pool).await?;
let applied: Vec<String> = apply_pending(&pool, &migrations).await?;
```

The runner:

1. compares each input migration against `cratestack_migrations`
2. skips already-applied rows whose checksum matches
3. aborts with `CoolError::Internal` if an applied row's checksum has drifted
4. for each pending row: opens a transaction, executes every statement in `up`, inserts the record into `cratestack_migrations`, commits

A failure in any statement rolls the whole migration back. A multi-
statement script with a broken second statement leaves zero artefacts —
the first `CREATE TABLE` rolls back with the failed `CREATE INDEX`, and
`cratestack_migrations` does **not** record the partial attempt.

## Checksum drift

Each migration's checksum is `SHA-256(id || \0 || description || \0 || up)`.
Editing an already-applied migration in source control changes the
checksum:

```text
migration `20260101000000_create_accounts` is recorded as applied but its
SQL has changed; resolve drift before continuing
```

The runner refuses to apply anything until the drift is resolved. Banks
treat this as a release-process failure to escalate to humans — there is
no `--force` flag. Restoring the original SQL or rolling forward with a
new migration are the two acceptable resolutions.

## Inspecting state

`status(&pool, &migrations)` returns one `MigrationState` per input:

```rust
pub struct MigrationState {
    pub id: String,
    pub status: MigrationStatus,
}

pub enum MigrationStatus {
    Pending,
    Applied,
    ChecksumMismatch,
}
```

Banks plug this into a deployment dashboard so operators see drift before
the next deploy attempt.

## Multi-statement scripts

Postgres prepared statements accept exactly one command per round-trip,
so the runner splits `up` on `;` and executes each non-empty statement
sequentially inside the same transaction. Common patterns this enables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE transfers (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount BIGINT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX transfers_status_idx ON transfers (status);
INSERT INTO transfers_status_lookup (key, label)
    VALUES ('pending', 'Pending'), ('settled', 'Settled');
```

All three statements land atomically. A failure in the `INSERT` rolls the
`CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE INDEX` back together.

## What the runner is not

1. not a `down`/rollback engine — `down` is recorded for audit but never run
2. not a parallel-applier — migrations are sequential and serialized through the tracking table
3. not a long-running-migration coordinator — banks executing a 6-hour `ALTER TABLE` use their own backfill tooling and record the migration as a no-op when the backfill is done

## Generating migrations from `.cstack`

The runner consumes SQL migrations identically whether they are hand-written or generated. CrateStack ships a separate **schema diff generator** that produces those migrations from `.cstack` against a committed schema snapshot — see [ADR 0004](../internals/schema-diff-adr) for the full design.

Three commands cover the lifecycle:

* `cratestack migrate diff` — offline. Diffs the current `.cstack` against `migrations/<backend>/schema.snapshot.json` and writes a new migration directory.
* `cratestack migrate verify` — CI gate. Replays the full migration history against an ephemeral DB and checks the result matches the snapshot.
* `cratestack migrate drift` — ops tool. Reports differences between the snapshot and a live database. Read-only.

Generated migrations remain reviewable SQL diffs — that property is preserved. The generator just removes the hand-translation step from `.cstack` to SQL. Destructive operations (column drop, lossy type change) still require explicit opt-in, and renames still require an explicit `@rename` annotation.

Hand-written migration steps coexist with generated ones via optional `up.pre.sql` / `up.post.sql` files inside the migration directory; the generator never overwrites them. Use these for backfills, lookup-table seeds, materialized-view refreshes, and any transform the diff engine cannot infer.

## Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE cratestack_migrations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    checksum BYTEA NOT NULL,
    applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The DDL is exposed as `cratestack::MIGRATIONS_TABLE_DDL` and applied
idempotently by `ensure_migrations_table`.
